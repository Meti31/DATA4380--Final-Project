#  Diabetic Retinopathy Detection Using Residual Neural Network
 
 This repository holds an attempt to apply ResNet to Retina Images to Detect Diabetic Retinopathy using data from "Diabetic Retinopathy Detection" Challenge https://www.kaggle.com/c/diabetic-retinopathy-detection" 
 
 #  Overview
 
  The dataset have a large set of high-resolution retina images taken under a variety of imaging conditions. A left and right field is provided for every subject. Images are labeled with a subject id as well as either left or right 
A clinician has rated the presence of diabetic retinopathy in each image on a scale of 0 to 4, according to the following scale:

0 - No DR
1 - Mild
2 - Moderate
3 - Severe
4 - Proliferative DR

The task is  to create an automated analysis system capable of assigning a score based on this scale.
In this repository ResNet is used to try to predict
